# [DocumentDetector](https://docs.caf.io/sdks/flutter/getting-started/document-detector/v7-and-above)

The DocumentDetector SDK is designed for capturing identity documents, such as the Brazilian General Registry (RG), Drivers License (CNH), National Foreigner Registry (RNE), Passport and other identity documents, ensuring high quality and accuracy in documentary data extraction. By integrating our smart camera with automatic capture and document detection into your app, you can eliminate poor quality or unwanted photos during onboarding.
